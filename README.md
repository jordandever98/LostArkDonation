# LostArkDonation
Donates on up to 9 characters in Lost Ark. 
For this project to work properly, the attended user must start on the Character Selection Screen and it will go through a number of characters the user selects. Since this is an attended bot, the user cannot use their mouse or keyboard or it will disrupt the hardware click events that donate silver and support research. Users also must be in the setting of 21:9 and may not work with users with widescreen monitors.
